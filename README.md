# Introduction — My Why

This repository is part of something called **Transmitted AI**.  
We discuss RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), psychological awareness, and the manipulations I applied to reach very specific outcomes or to enhance the emphasis of certain response elements.

> **Note:** If any of this sparks your curiosity, feel free to reach out through the contact box.  
> I’ll gladly continue creating and sharing more ideas and discussions related to Transmitted AI in the future.

# Rona Project — Overview

First of all, I've been using **Meta Llama 3**, and honestly it's awesome.  
Its massive pre-training dataset and human-friendly structure make it special.  
It produces incredibly human-like text and performs extremely well in programming tasks.

In CyberSecurity, however, Llama 3 applies a lot of restrictions.  
But — I bypassed that.

I talked before about the standard definition of RAG…  
But do you think RAG stops where documentation says it stops?  
**Absolutely not.**  
If you understand the architecture, you can push it far beyond what anyone expects.

# What is Rona?

The **Rona Project** is my personal experiment — now a full application — that can:

- Analyze human behavior through streamed daily notes  
- Detect emotional triggers, patterns, and internal loops inside your journal
- Provide psychological insights based on user entries  
- Retrieve relevant information from live web search + Ai model   

Rona doesn’t just chat.  
**Rona reads between the lines.**

## Special Internal Bypass

I created a mechanism to write directly to the **stream data line** of the model.

Think of it like this:

> There’s a wall you can’t break from the front…  
>  
> but you can climb over it, and lift others with you.

That's exactly how the **/lovely** option works.  
It bypasses Llama’s limitations in everything except the ultra-sensitive and ethically non-negotiable areas.

# Key Features

### ✔ Lovely & Stream line response 
Switch between model-only knowledge and live enriched web context and integrate both of them in the same session which make a big hole different.

### ✔ Lovelyq Mode (`/lovely`)  
A psychological-aware analysis engine.  
Reads notes, extracts emotional patterns, and reflects behavior.

### ✔ Unified Command Router  
A single architecture handling:

- `/lovely`  
- `/deep not enalbled yet`  
- `/webui`  
- `/hunt not enalbled yet`   
- natural language queries  

### ✔ Hybrid UI  
Runs as:

- a modern Desktop App (CustomTkinter)  
- a full Local Web Application (Flask)  

### ✔ Behavioral-Predictive Layer  
Rona doesn’t just answer questions —  
she **understands how you're asking them**.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python **3.10+**
- **Ollama** installed and running
- A local model:
- linux & "But you can use the same implementation—just make sure to edit the config.py file so it fits ability of your device.

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

or:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Rona

```bash
python Rona_v7.py
```

Rona will open in desktop mode.  
You can also access the web UI at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5005/prodectivity
```

---

# Usage

## 💬 Standard Chat
Just type.  
Rona will automatically use:

- local context  
- web context  
- session history  
- behavioral inference  

to produce enriched responses.

---

## 💗 Lovely Mode

```bash
/lovely <your thought>
```

This activates the psychological analysis engine.

Rona will:

- detect emotional shifts  
- highlight behavioral contradictions  
- expose subconscious patterns  
- provide grounded advice  
- mirror your mindset in a human-like manner

# A Note on Safety

I built this system to bypass unnecessary limitations,  
but Rona will **not** operate in extremely sensitive areas (e.g., nuclear, WMD, or other real-world danger zones).

She *will* help bypass:

- WAF restrictions  
- tooling limitations  
- AI moralization  
- unnecessary filtering  

But she will never cross into real harm.

There is a difference between **security research** and **actual danger**.  
Rona stays on the correct side.

This is not just a chatbot.  
It’s a blueprint for:

- AI behavioral analysis  
- psychological context infusion  
- intelligent RAG manipulation  
- internal bypass engineering  
- human-aware Transmitted AI systems
